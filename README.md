# P2P Invoice Settlement

## Project Title
**P2P Invoice Settlement**

## Project Description
The **P2P Invoice Settlement** contract is a decentralized solution for peer-to-peer (P2P) invoice creation, payment, and settlement on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows issuers to create invoices and send them to payers. Payers can then settle the invoice by paying the required amount, and issuers can cancel the invoice if needed. The contract ensures transparency, security, and immutability, making it ideal for decentralized business operations.

## Project Vision
The vision of the **P2P Invoice Settlement** contract is to facilitate secure and transparent invoice management without the need for intermediaries. By using the Ethereum blockchain, this system enables trustless, decentralized transactions between peers, making it an efficient tool for businesses and individuals who prefer to manage their invoicing and payments on the blockchain.

## Key Features
- **Invoice Creation**: Issuers can create invoices with a specified amount and a designated payer.
- **Invoice Payment**: Payers can settle the invoice by sending the correct amount, and the issuer receives the payment.
- **Invoice Cancellation**: Issuers can cancel an invoice if it is still in the "Created" status (i.e., not yet paid).
- **Transparency**: All actions, including the creation, payment, and cancellation of invoices, are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency for both parties.
- **Security**: The contract uses only the involved parties (issuer and payer) to interact with the respective invoice, ensuring that unauthorized actions are prevented.

## Future Scope
- **Partial Payments**: Enable functionality for partial invoice payments (e.g., allowing payers to pay in installments).
- **Invoice Dispute Mechanism**: Implement a system where users can dispute invoices, with an arbitration process to resolve issues.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Extend the contract to support different types of tokens or cryptocurrencies beyond Ether (ETH).
- **Escrow Feature**: Add an escrow functionality where funds are held securely until both parties confirm the transaction is completed.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Develop a user-friendly web or mobile interface for non-technical users to interact with the smart contract.
